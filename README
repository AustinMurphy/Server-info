Sysadmin Tools -- Server information

  Automatic information collection and formatting.
  The point is to aid in documenting all servers.

  Works with wide variety of Linux servers
    Platform: Dell, VMware, Generic 
    CPUs: Intel, AMD
    OS: RHEL, CentOS : 4, 5, 6 : 32, 64
  
  It is fairly strightforward to extend. Just grep/sed/...

  Data collection is separated from wiki formatting.

  Some of the parts make simplifying assumptions that could be wrong.
  - cpus and memory modules are assumed to be identical
  - network interfaces must be documented in /etc/hosts
    each ip and hostname must only appear once


Note: Requires bash 4 for the associative array feature.
      (FYI - RHEL5 comes with bash 3)
